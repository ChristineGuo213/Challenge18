# Blockchain

This Python file builds a blockchain-based ledger system, and completes with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

## Technologies

This project leverages Python 3.7, its library Streamlit, Pandas, hashlib, typing, and dataclasses with the following packages and dependencies:

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - An open-source data analysis and manipulation tool

* [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes

* [hashlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html) - Secure hashes and message digests

* [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) - Support for type hints

* [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) -  Provides a decorator and functions for automatically adding generated special methods

* [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) -  Supplies classes for manipulating dates and times
